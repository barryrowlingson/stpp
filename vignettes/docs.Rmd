Many of the models encountered in applications of point process methods to the study of spatio-temporal phenomena are covered in 'stpp'. This package provides statistical tools for analyzing the global and local second-order properties of spatio-temporal point processes, including estimators of the space-time inhomogeneous K-function and pair correlation function among others. It also includes tools to get static and dynamic display of spatio-temporal point patterns.
